# Title

When PowerShell module support first came out in PowerShell 2.0, module manifests had a specific list of keys that could be used to define the manifest. Additional keys were added in PowerShell 3.0, but that hurt the end user experience because at the time, if you loaded a module with a manifest containing keys that were not recognized/supported in your version of PowerShell, PowerShell would return an unhelpful error about the module keys being invalid instead of checking for the minimum required version of PowerShell and returning an error indicating that the module only supports that version or later.

Beyond PowerShell 3.0, keys started being added to a PSData subsection of the PrivateData area of modules. You can see these keys in use by the PowerShell Gallery. That approach has its own challenges, because now keys are defined in a hierarchy, which adds complexity and should not be necessary.

Fast forward to today, and things have changed enough that we can reconsider how we set up a module manifest. `Import-Module` has been checking the required version of PowerShell before validating key names for several years now (at least since PowerShell 5.1).  Earlier versions of Windows PowerShell are no longer on mainstream support.

With all of this in mind, I propose that we flatten the module manifest structure, reading values for keys at the root first, and then if they are not set at the root, looking in the PSData section under PrivateData for backwards compatibility support. Future keys added to the manifest as part of PowerShell should all be added to the root, leaving `PrivateData` for 3rd party or user information in a manifest, like it was intended.

## Motivation

    As a scripter,
    I can generate manifests using `New-ModuleManifest` with all keys stored at the root of the hashtable,
    so that I can work with module manifests more easily.

## User Experience

Here's an example showing how `New-ModuleManifest` would work after this change:

```powershell
New-ModuleManifest .\test.psd1 -PassThru | Get-Content
```

```output
#
# Module manifest for module 'test'

```

## Specification

The changes required for this RFC are relatively straightforward, and as follows:

1. `New-ModuleManifest` would generate a template like what is shown above, omitting any details about the `PSData` section.
1. Module import logic would read the manifest and pull the values for `Tags`, `LicenseUri`, `ProjectUri`, `IconUri` and `ReleaseNotes` from the top-level keys. If top-level keys were not defined with these values, it would look for values in a `PSData` section for backward compatibility.
1. If values are defined in both locations, an error would occur informing the module author that they need to remove one of the two keys.
1. Update `Test-ModuleManifest` to validate the keys in the new locations.
1. Update `Update-ModuleManifest` to set the keys in the existing location if it is in use, or in the new location otherwise.

## Alternate Proposals and Considerations

### Move `Update-ModuleManifest` from PowerShellGet to Microsoft.PowerShell.Core

This is a question for consideration: why is `Update-ModuleManifest` part of PowerShellGet and not in the Microsoft.PowerShell.Core module? Shouldn't it be co-located with the other `*-ModuleManifest` cmdlets? If so, it could be moved as part of this RFC.
