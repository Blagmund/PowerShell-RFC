## Notes
* Happy 15th birthday PowerShell! PowerShell is all about the community- thanks for all the support!
* Welcome Steven to the PM team
* We reached GA for PowerShell 7.2, check out the blog post and what's new documentation for details
* Please let us know if there are any issues
* We will be working on a PowerShell 7.3 roadmap/PowerShell all up in the coming months
* We are looking into geting PowerShell 7 in Windows, we are working on an RFC on the approach for this
* The two big challenges are size (PowerShell 7 needs to ship .Net with it) and support lifecycle (.Net only has a 3 year support lifecycle vs Windows requires 5)
* We released an update to our PowerShell Preview extension for VSCode in October
* Thank you so much to all the community support on this Preview release
* We expect this work to come to the stable extension in the coming months, we are working through bugs and updating our tests
* PowerShell 7.3-preview.1 is expected in December
* We plan to have our next preview release of PowerShellGet in December
* We have completed the PowerShell Gallery migration and hope to address more issues in the coming months
* The community can help by inviting more folks into the feedback loop for PowerShell
* We want to hear about the challenges you are facing in your work
* Look forward to a new effort to help feature teams have an awesome PowerShell experience
* The updatable help pipeline will point to the correct docs in the first servicing release for 7.2
* We have started moving PSSA docs out of the source repo and into the Microsoft Docs platform
* We are targeting GA for PSReadLine 2.2 in January, current focus is on stability
* PowerShell 7.2 is compatible with PSReadLine 2.2 beta4
* PSReadline 2.2 is compatible back to Windows PowerShell, but not all of the features will be available-- the AzPS predictor is only available on PowerShell 7.2+
* We are continuing work on OpenSSH-- look for multiple updates in the new year
* Steve will open an issue in the RFC repo for folks to comment if they would like to join the committees
* We dont have any plans for the providers, but it is not forgotten work
* We will have more to announce on DSCv3 next year
