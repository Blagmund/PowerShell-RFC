## Notes

- Welcome Alyssa! Focusing on PSGet and PSGallery
- 7.3 RC next month in September. Much more conservative on changes to take, reducing
  regression/instability risk
- 7.4 previews towards the end of the year
- 7.0 in support until December 2022
- Max three releases a month, if no 7.0/7.2 release then we will have 7.4 preview.
- Soon moving master branch to consume .NET SDKs RC
  - Few .NET regressions we found because of that we have not been shipping ready to run binaries
      for 7.3 previews
- Try and use daily builds soon! Would love feedback on it
- Made a LOT of progress with vscode ext tests, few key ones:
  - Debugger breaking in untitled script, have unit tests
  - dot sourcing operator regression tests
  - end to end integration testing for VIM
- PowerShellGet Updates
  - Preview release 3.0-preview16- currently not supported on PowerShell 7.0, 7.1 or 7.2-preview1
      due to dependency issues.
    - Refactor ScriptFile cmdlets
    - Refactored Update-ModuleManifest
    - Authenticode check for Install-PSResource
