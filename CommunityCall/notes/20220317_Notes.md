## Notes

- Theme of today's call is the teams' 2022 investments
- We have released servicing updates for PowerShell 7+
- The latest preview release is still on .Net 6, but future will .Net 7
- We are making improvements to local SessionConfiguration support probably by adding a new keyword
- This would allow for support of things like SSH endpoints, setting language mode, import modules ect.

- We have made enhancements to AMSI and WDAC, these are Windows only security features
- Azure Mariner is a version of linux which we will be making packages available as well as docker containers
- We are also investing in  Windows ARM64 MSI packages which will allow us to keep these things up to date
