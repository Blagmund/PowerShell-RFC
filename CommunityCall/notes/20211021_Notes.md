## Notes

* We are getting very close to PowerShell 7.2 RC1-- watch twitter/release page
* This is an LTS release, with a focus on stability-- thanks to all the community feedback
* This is a "go-live", meaning it is supported in production
* We are targeting November for the 7.2 release
* November is PowerShell's 15th birthday (will celebrate at next community call)
* Modules are where a lot of innovation is happening
* We will have a PowerShell session BRK260 at Ignite (PowerShell UnPlugged)
* We will also have an Ask the Experts at Ignite on November 3rd
* Check out our FAQ on the Microsoft Update options
* Working on migrating PowerShell Gallery from RDFE to ARM
* Because this work is cross regional it was a larger work item
* This shouldn't impact the Gallery but the change should occur next week (Tuesday/Wednesday)
* Please open up an issue on GitHub with any questions/concerns
* We will keep the status page updated
* Thanks for testing out our PowerShellGet preview release, expect another release in November
