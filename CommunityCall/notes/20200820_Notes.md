  * One more Preview 7 planned for the first week of September to add some final feature code
  * Release Candidates planned for late September and October with GA in November
    * Plan is to only take very high-priority bug fixes in RC
  * Anything that doesn't make 7.1 will ship in 7.2
  * Decisions on which experimental features remain experimental in 7.1 in
    [this issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13406)
* Preview 6 has been officially submitted to the Microsoft Store
  * Several days to go through the certification process
  * We *believe* we've done the right things to be published, but we will see
* Totally hear @iSazonov's feedback on lack of roadmap and backlog of PRs
  * We're establishing Working Groups to decentralize management of `Area-*` labeled
    PRs and issues
* Semantic Highlighting in the PowerShell Preview extension for Visual Studio Code
  * Old syntax highlighting was based on regex, but it's limited in functionality
  * New syntax highlighting is using PowerShell's tokenizer
* Updates on the updateable help pipeline
  * Committed to continuing to improve the Update-Help system so that they see the same docs on the web and in the console
    * Fixes to Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.1
    * New internal CI/CD feature to accelerate adoption of new pipeline by partner
      teams in Windows and Office
    * If you see any issues in `Update-Help`, please file an issue in
      [PowerShell-Docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs)
* [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) updates
  * Now support running containers inside customers' virtual network
    * This means you can manage machines or Kubernetes clusters with private IPs 
    * Supported in a small handful of regions today, rolling out to more on an ongoing basis
  * Container image for Cloud Shell is now [open-sourced](https://github.com/azure/cloudshell)
    * PRs are open! Just make sure to check [Contributing in the README](https://github.com/azure/cloudshell#contributing)
