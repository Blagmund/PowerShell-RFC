Marc-Andre Moreau
Hello everyone! this is my first time attending

Kvprasoon
Oops,Sry, that's due to a network glitch

Justin Grote [MVP]
@Marc welcome!

Marc-Andre Moreau
Will PSRemoting custom transports be discussed today?

Aleksandar
Could you increase a font size a little?

JoshCorr
Is 7.2 slated to be the next LTS version? And if so is there a way of suppressing the "New Version avalible" message for LTS versions?

Adil
Plans for Christmas, Joey?

Justin Grote [MVP]
@Marc it's on the Community Call question list so yes as long as there's time which there usually is.

Thomas Rayner
Merry Christmas, y'all! Can you share any updates regarding the PS VS Code extension, and Tyler's new role on the Code team?

brima
Is there any news about the Module WindowsUpdateProvider? Doesn't work now for more than 1 year! Error: Provider cannot be loaded.

Justin Grote [MVP]
@Thomas it's #1 on the github list both in order and likes so I imagine that will be addressed :)

Justin Grote [MVP]
@brima PSWindowsUpdate module isn't owned by the powershell team. It's owned by Michal Gajda, you'd have to ask him.

JB "AspenForester" Lewis
That looks reasonable

Justin Grote [MVP]
Disregard this comment, I searched wrong :)(Justin Grote [MVP]  asked "@brima PSWindowsUpdate module isn't owned by the powershell team. It's owned by Michal Gajda, you'd have to ask him.")

Joey Aiello
Yes it is going to be an LTS. As for the
"New version available" feature, I *thought* we had setup the logic such that LTS would only show updates within the LTS branch (e.g. 7.0.1 should show updates for 7.0.2 and not 7.1), but that logic may not be what we actually shipped.

Are you in 7.0.x and being bugged about 7.1.x updates? (JoshCorr  asked "Is 7.2 slated to be the next LTS version? And if so is there a way of suppressing the "New Version avalible" message for LTS versions?")

Ewerton JordÃ£o
Updates about Notebooks and PowerShell ?

Justin Grote [MVP]
@Ewerton Tyler was mostly owning that and he moved to the VSCode team so I wouldn't expect much :)

Jeff Hicks
Is there a quick "remove all formatting" command?

Aleksandar
For defaults, the accessibility team could provide an input

Jeff Hicks
If you copy a colored property to the clipboard does it include the ANSI code or just the property value?

Got a link to the issue regarding the new progress bars for comments?

@Justin Grote [MVP] I ask for the module WindowsUpdateProvider, not for the module PSWindowsUpdate.
WindowsUpdateProvider is a inbox module!

Has this just be accidentally ended?

Keith Hill
The event ended for me just now

Steve Lee (POWERSHELL)
Sorry, accidental end of live event, we're trying to figure this out

Steve Lee (POWERSHELL)
Joey is creating a new event, the old aka.ms/joinpscall will be updated to it(Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) asked "Sorry, accidental end of live event, we're trying to figure this out")

Steve Lee (POWERSHELL)
Should be updated, please join again(Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) asked "Sorry, accidental end of live event, we're trying to figure this out")

Welcome Back :)

THERE WE GO. I couldn't use your link, I needed to manually type in aka.ms/joinpscall

JB "AspenForester" Lewis
I'm back!

Keith Hill
What, no confirmation dialog on ending event?  ðŸ˜œ

Jeff Hicks
There are no accidents. ;-)

Keith Hill
Confirm impact should be high on that operation. :-)

Joey Aiello
There is.... :-p(Keith Hill  asked "What, no confirmation dialog on ending event?  ðŸ˜œ")

Will PowerShell 7.2 eventually be LTS? And is there a way to supress the "Newer Version" message for the LTS versions (until there is a new LTS version)?

Joey Aiello
FYI, I still have questions open from the Take 1 call that got ended abruptly, so I'll be dragging those forward

Steve Lee (POWERSHELL)
7.2 is expected to be LTS(JoshCorr  asked "Will PowerShell 7.2 eventually be LTS? And is there a way to supress the "Newer Version" message for the LTS versions (until there is a new LTS version)? ")

Joey Aiello
I relplied in the last call to this one(JoshCorr  asked "Will PowerShell 7.2 eventually be LTS? And is there a way to supress the "Newer Version" message for the LTS versions (until there is a new LTS version)? ")

Marc-Andre Moreau
Can you clarify what is the original demand that triggered the Crescendo project? It looks like it is meant for people who wouldn't be comfortable trying to wrap native commands, even if you currently already do that in PowerShell "manually" quite well

JoshCorr
I am getting spammed about 7.1 in 7.0.3 version. Can't post a screen shot here, but will look at posting an issue to Github.(JoshCorr  asked "Will PowerShell 7.2 eventually be LTS? And is there a way to supress the "Newer Version" message for the LTS versions (until there is a new LTS version)? ")

JoshCorr
And Sorry I missed your response. Thanks for answering again. :) (JoshCorr  asked "Will PowerShell 7.2 eventually be LTS? And is there a way to supress the "Newer Version" message for the LTS versions (until there is a new LTS version)? ")

Jason Milczek
Does anyone know when the AzureAD module will be available for PowerShell Core?

Joey Aiello
No worries, thanks for the info. We'll have to look into that(JoshCorr  asked "Will PowerShell 7.2 eventually be LTS? And is there a way to supress the "Newer Version" message for the LTS versions (until there is a new LTS version)? ")

Any ETA on AzureAD module for PowerShell Core?

Any news on psunixcompleters? Is is still moving forward?

Marc-Andre Moreau
Is there documentation on how to produce similar, professional-looking PowerShell module documentations when using DocFX for third-party modules? I've adopted DocFX for my product docs, but so far it's just manual markdown, nothing directly integrated with the modules I document.

Marc-Andre Moreau
the sudo command support got unblocked recently - Jordan did an almost completed proof-of-concept that really works

Marc-Andre Moreau
it just needs some further push from the team and it could definitely happen

Sean Wheeler
You can create markdown help for your modules using PlatyPS. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dev-cross-plat/create-help-using-platyps?view=powershell-7.1(Marc-Andre Moreau  asked "Is there documentation on how to produce similar, professional-looking PowerShell module documentations when using DocFX for third-party modules?

JoshCorr
https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/14452 went ahead and put something in. Don't mind helping out on this one as well. (JoshCorr  asked "Will PowerShell 7.2 eventually be LTS?

Marc-Andre Moreau
What would be the best for community contributors to help fast track alternative PSRemoting transports? it doesn't have to be very complicated with a whole plugin system

Justin Grote [MVP]
Can we just do a small PR to just un-hardcode the 'ssh.exe' and make it a default but configurable? This is a small nonbreaking fix. Waiting on all the subsystem stuff is gonna take at least half a year.

Anonymous
The official support is not main issue. Will there be new beta releases?(OpenSSH needs to be supported out-of-band of Windows. How are we supposed to get v8.1, 8.2 or v8.3 on Windows Server 2012 R2 and above?)

b
The module WindowsUpdateProvider  work not with Windows PowerShell 5.1and work not with PowerShell 7.x

Steve Lee (POWERSHELL)
Is https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/12802 sufficient for what you need?(Justin Grote [MVP]  asked "Can we just do a small PR to just un-hardcode the 'ssh.exe' and make it a default but configurable?

Has it every been planned to support SSH remoting without OpenSSH, like libssh, or even putty?

Anonymous
Sorry, no published build from GitHub. I manually have to compile it(OpenSSH needs to be supported out-of-band of Windows. How are we supposed to get v8.1, 8.2 or v8.3 on Windows Server 2012 R2 and above?)

Justin Grote [MVP]
@Marc if they unhook the ssh.exe hardcode then anyone can write their own using those libraries and make a stdin/out

b
i do taht x-times in feedback hub :-(

Marc-Andre Moreau
To clarify: not officially by Microsoft, but supported by third-parties or by the community, it's just that PowerShell remoting for SSH is currently hardcoded specifically for the OpenSSH client. I got PowerShell remoting over SSH without SSH done by making a fake "ssh.exe" replacement, so in theory it's not that hard to make it possible

Marc-Andre Moreau
True, that is exactly how I managed to replace it - I prepend my replacement in the PATH before the real one
