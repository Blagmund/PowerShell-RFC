## Notes

* PowerShell 7.2-preview.8 ~1 month ago

  * GA ~Nov (tentative)
  * 7.0 LTS and 7.1 branches will be going out of support
* Just shipped 7.0.7 and 7.1.4
  * Update to these!
* PowerShell Gallery outage
  * ~3 hours of downtime
  * post-mortem and root cause by end of week
  * cleaning up a significant amount of technical debt
  * thank you for patience with growing pains
  * Make sure to report any issues to our [GitHub repo](github.com/powershell/powershellgallery)
* PowerShellGet 3.0
  * [Shipped 3.0 preivew-11](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershellget-3-0-preview-11-release/)
    * Better support for non-existent and relative paths on both Windows and Linux
    * Automatic registration of PSGallery repository
    * Solidified return output types (PSResourceInfo and PSRepositoryInfo)
    * File any issues you find on the [PowerShellGet repo](https://github.com/powershell/powershellget)
* Code coverage
  * Used to provide PowerShell code coverage numbers, but...
    * Only on Windows
    * 14-18 hour runs
  * Now, we're using coverlet
    * Assembly level code coverage (C#, not PS script)
    * Creates visualization report
    * Works cross-platform
* SecretManagement 1.1 GA and SecretStore
  * Check out the SecretManagement 1.1 GA blog [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/announcing-secretmanagement-1-1-ga/)
  * If you've tried the previews already, the GA is essentially the same
  * Primarily fixes around Constrained Language Mode (CLM)
  * SecretStore 1.0.3
    * Fixed race condition and bad error message
    * Also fixed some random reports of data corruption during configuration changes
  * Possible to configure SecretStore to not use an interactive password,
    but you will have less security
    * Can also be configured to be used non-interactively in automation with securely stored credentials
    * More info on the [repo](https://github.com/powershell/secretstore)
      and [in documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/utility-modules/overview?view=ps-modules)
* Microsoft Update for PS7
  * Will show up as a "quality update" for now
    * May be a "security update" in the future
  * Currently ~2 week delay for updates in Microsoft Update
* Updates to VS Code extension
  * Recently shipped a [new update to the stable and preview extensions](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-for-visual-studio-code-august-2021-update/)
    * Now using the bundled PSSA and PSReadline modules by default
    * Completely automated CI/CD infrastructure for testing and releasing extensions
    * Pretty new icons!
  * Expect another preview release very soon with some debug fixes
    * .NET tools enabling us to prevent a class of async/await problems like this in the future
  * We're now writing regression tests for all of our bug fixes
* PSScriptAnalyzer
  * Internal contributor making some improvements to PSSA for Windows validation
    * Essentially treat internal contributors the same as anyone outside MSFT,
    keeping most everything in GitHub
  * Some other new rules have been trickling in from both internal and external contributors
  * Definitely [file issues](https://github.com/powershell/psscriptanalyzer)
    if you have ideas for new features or rules in PSSA
  * Also lots of up-for-grabs issues if you're looking to get started contributing
* Docs update
  * You can check out the latest doc updates [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/community/2021-updates)
    * July brought some new and updated about_ topics
    * Documentation for modules not included as part of PowerShell are
      available under [utility modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/utility-modules/overview)
  * Coming soon: updates to install documentation for clarity and support info
