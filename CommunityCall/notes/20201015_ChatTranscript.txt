We havent done this internally but would be super excited to see a HashiCorp Vault come from the community (maybe someone has already taken a look?) (Joshcorr  asked "Has there been any testing against a HashiCorp Vault backend?")

It seems that most of the work for making native apps work better in PS did not make it into 7.1. Will 7.2 attempt to complete this work?
